 * @brief %Prober to confirm that a record is unique

 * Before responding to queries for a record, its uniqueness on the network
 * must be confirmed. This class takes care of probing for existing records
 * that match and adjusts the record's name until a unique one is found.
 *
 * For example, to probe for a SRV record:
 *
 * @code
 * QMdnsEngine::Record record;
 * record.setName("My Service._http._tcp.local.");
 * record.setType(QMdnsEngine::SRV);
 * record.setPort(1234);
 * record.setTarget(hostname.hostname());
 *
 * QMdnsEngine::Prober prober(&server, record);
 * connect(&prober, &QMdnsEngine::Prober::nameConfirmed, [](const QByteArray &name) {
 *     qDebug() << "Name confirmed:" << name;
 * });
