 * This class provides a simple way to discover services on the local network.
 * A cache may be provided in the constructor to store records for future

 *
 * To browse for services of any type:
 *
 * @code
 * QMdnsEngine::Browser browser(&server, QMdnsEngine::MdnsBrowseType);
 * @endcode
 *
 * To browse for services of a specific type:
 *
 * @code
 * QMdnsEngine::Browser browser(&server, "_http._tcp.local.");
 * @endcode
 *
 * When a service is found, the serviceAdded() signal is emitted:
 *
 * @code
 * connect(&browser, &QMdnsEngine::Browser::serviceAdded, [](const QMdnsEngine::Service &service) {
 *     qDebug() << "Service added:" << service.name();
 * });
 * @endcode
 *
 * The serviceUpdated() and serviceRemoved() signals are emitted when services
 * are updated (their properties change) or are removed, respectively.
