 * @brief %Resolver for services

 * When [Browser](@ref QMdnsEngine::Browser) indicates that a new service has
 * been found, it becomes necessary to resolve the service in order to connect
 * to it. This class serves that role. A [Cache](@ref QMdnsEngine::Cache) can
 * optionally be provided to speed up the resolving process.
 *
 * For example, assuming that `record` is a SRV record:
 *
 * @code
 * QMdnsEngine::Resolver resolver(&server, record.target());
 * connect(&resolver, &QMdnsEngine::Resolver::resolved, [](const QHostAddress &address) {
 *     qDebug() << "Address:" << address;
